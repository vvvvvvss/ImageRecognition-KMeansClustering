# KMeansClustering
Image Classification using KMeans Clustering   
   
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into a pre-defined number of clusters.
The goal is to group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns or structures within the data.
To process the learning data, the K-means algorithm in data mining starts with a first group of randomly selected centroids, 
which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative (repetitive) calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids.






 Data Normalization is an important preprocessing step which ensures that each input parameter (pixel, in this case) has a similar data distribution. 
  This fastens the process of covergence while training the model. Also Normalization makes sure no one particular parameter influences the output significantly.
